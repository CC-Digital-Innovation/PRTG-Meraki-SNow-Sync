# PRTG-Meraki-SNow-Sync

## Summary
Synchronizes existing devices seen in PRTG, Meraki, and ServiceNow together. The data synced includes device names, MAC addresses, IPv4 addresses, and serial numbers.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Keeps our ServiceNow CMDB updated with the latest devices in our network system infrastructure
and notifies engineers of discrepancies amongst these systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.1
- configparser
- meraki
- pysnow
- pytz
- requests

## Usage
- Edit the config file with relevant PRTG, Meraki, and ServiceNow access 
  information as well as the name of the logger.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python PRTG-Meraki-SNow-Sync.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.11.1.
